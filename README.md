# LogVision for NovaSeq 6000  
> Effective management of Illumina NovaSeq 6000 workflows requires real-time insights into server logs, including activity, performance, and potential issues. This software parses and analyzes BaseSpace Sequence Hub and bcl2fastq logs to optimize epigenomic data pipelines.

## Mechanisms  
Please refer to the following documentation for more information on Illumina server logging:  
- [Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System Guide](https://support.illumina.com/documentation.html)  
- [bcl2fastq Conversion Guide](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html)
